## Overview
A brief description of the project, its purpose, and its goals. Mention the context (e.g., 10 Academy Week 1 Challenge) and what the project achieves (e.g., financial news and stock market data analysis).

Example:  
This repository contains code and analysis for the 10 Academy Week 1 Challenge, focusing on analyzing financial news and stock market trends using Python, with visualizations for stock prices, SMA, RSI, MACD, and daily returns.

## Features
List key functionalities or highlights of the project in bullet points.

- Data fetching using `yfinance`.
- Visualizations for stock prices, SMA, RSI, MACD, and daily returns).
- Automated unit testing with GitHub Actions.
- Modular code structure with reusable scripts.

## Setup Instructions
Step-by-step guide to set up the project locally.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

  ```bash
  python scripts/fetch_data.py
  ```
- Execute unit tests:
  ```bash
  pytest tests/
  ```

## Progress
Summarize completed tasks and milestones.

- **Task 1**: Initialized Git, set up Python environment, and conducted EDA (branch: `task-1`).
- **Task 3**: Added visualizations for stock metrics and merged changes (branch: `task-3`, commit: `294f216`).
